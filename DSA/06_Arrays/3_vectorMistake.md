Here is the corrected version of your code, followed by an explanation of the errors and the comparison you requested.

### Corrected C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string> // Required for <string> type, though not used in the final corrected code

// Using std namespace as in your original code
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // CORRECTION 1: You must specify the data type inside < >
    // This creates a vector that can ONLY hold integers.
    vector<int> v1 = {1, 2, 3};

    // This creates a new vector 'v2' and *copies* all elements from 'v1'.
    // v2 is a completely separate copy.
    vector<int> v2 = v1;

    // This removes the last element (3) from v2 only.
    v2.pop_back();

    // changing v2 does not change v1 (Corrected your comment)
    cout << "--- Vector v1 (Original) ---" << endl;
    for (int x : v1) {
        cout << x << endl;
    }

    cout << "\n--- Vector v2 (Copy after pop_back) ---" << endl;
    for (int x : v2) {
        cout << x << endl;
    }

    // CORRECTION 2: This line will NOT compile and has been commented out.
    // v2.push_back("Hello");

    // EXPLANATION: v2 is a 'vector<int>'. It can ONLY hold integers.
    // "Hello" is a string literal (const char*).
    // C++ is a statically-typed language; you cannot mix types in a
    // standard vector like you can in a Python list.

    // If you wanted a vector of strings, you would declare it as:
    // vector<string> v3 = {"1", "2"};
    // v3.push_back("Hello"); // This would be perfectly valid.

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Errors

1.  **Missing Type Declaration:** In C++, `std::vector` is a *template*, not a type itself. You must always specify the type of data it will hold, like `vector<int>` for integers or `vector<string>` for strings. Your original `vector v1` is missing this.
2.  **Type Mismatch:** Your biggest error was `v2.push_back("Hello")`. Since `v2` was created to hold integers (from `v1 = {1,2,3}`), you cannot add a string (`"Hello"`) to it. C++ is **statically typed**, meaning a container's type is fixed when it's compiled and cannot be changed.

### C++ `std::vector` vs. Python `list`

This is a fundamental difference between the two languages. Your code errors highlight the two biggest distinctions: **typing** and **assignment behavior**.

Here's a direct comparison:

| Feature | C++ `std::vector<T>` | Python `list` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Typing** | **Static & Homogeneous** | **Dynamic & Heterogeneous** |
| | All elements *must* be of the same type `T` (e.g., all `int` or all `string`). This is checked at compile-time. | A single list can hold *different* types (e.g., `[1, "hello", True]`). |
| **Assignment (`v2 = v1`)**| **Deep Copy** | **Reference Assignment** |
| | Creates a brand new, independent copy of the vector. Your code correctly shows this: changing `v2` **does not** change `v1`. | Makes `v2` point to the *exact same* list in memory. Changing `v2` **will** also change `v1`. |
| **Memory** | A **contiguous block of values** (or objects). Very fast for iteration. | An array of **pointers** to objects. The objects themselves can be scattered in memory. |
| **Performance** | Generally **faster** due to direct memory access and no runtime type-checking. | Generally **slower** due to memory indirection and the overhead of dynamic typing. |

### Key Takeaways

1.  **Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous**

      * A C++ `vector<int>` can *only* hold integers. Your attempt to add `"Hello"` fails at compile time. This is a **homogeneous** (all the same type) container.
      * A Python `list` can hold anything. `my_list = [1, 2, 3]` and then `my_list.append("Hello")` is perfectly valid. This is a **heterogeneous** (mixed types) container.

2.  **Copy vs. Reference**

      * **C++:** `vector<int> v2 = v1;`
          * This creates a **deep copy**. `v1` and `v2` are two separate vectors that just happen to start with the same values.
          * `v1` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2, 3]`
          * `v2` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2, 3]` (a *new* copy in a different memory location)
          * When you call `v2.pop_back()`, only `v2` is changed:
          * `v1` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2, 3]`
          * `v2` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2]`
      * **Python:** `v2 = v1`
          * This creates a **new reference** (also called a shallow copy or assignment). `v1` and `v2` both point to the *exact same object* in memory.
          * `v1` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2, 3]`
          * `v2` $\nearrow$ (points to the *same* `[1, 2, 3]`)
          * When you call `v2.pop()`, the single list that *both* variables point to is changed:
          * `v1` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2]`
          * `v2` $\nearrow$ (points to the *same* `[1, 2]`)
      * To get the C++ "deep copy" behavior in Python, you must be explicit: `v2 = v1.copy()` or `v2 = v1[:]`.
