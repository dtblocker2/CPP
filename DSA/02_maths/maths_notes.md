# make notes on

Here are concise **notes** based on the provided transcript about counting the number of digits in an integer.

## Problem Statement

- Given an integer **x**, the goal is to count the number of digits in **x**.
- Example: For **x = 9235**, the output is **4**; for **x = 38**, output is **2**; for **x = 7**, output is **1**.


## Constraints

- The input integer **x** is always **greater than zero**.


## Task Requirement

- Write a function that takes an integer **x** and returns the **count of digits** in **x**.


## Approach and Idea

- Remove the last digit one by one using integer division by 10 (i.e., **x = x // 10** in most programming languages).
- Each removal reduces the number by one digit from the right.
- Continue the process and increment a count each time until **x** becomes zero.


### Example Walkthrough

- For **x = 789**:
    - First iteration: **x = 789//10 = 78**, count = 1
    - Second iteration: **x = 78//10 = 7**, count = 2
    - Third iteration: **x = 7//10 = 0**, count = 3
    - Stop when **x = 0**. The count (**3**) is the number of digits.


## Implementation Details

- The method works the same in **C++** and **Java** due to similar syntax for integer division and loops.
- Create a main function to accept input and call the digit-counting function.


## Time Complexity

- The number of loop iterations equals the number of digits **d** in the input number.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is **Θ(d)**.

***

### Quick Reference Table

| Step | Action | Example (x = 789) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Initialize count=0 | Start with 0 digits counted | count = 0 |
| Loop | While x > 0 | x = 789 |
| Divide by 10 | x = x // 10 | x becomes 78 |
| Increment count | count += 1 | count becomes 1 |
| Check if x==0 | Continue until x is 0 | repeat until done |
| Stop \& Output | Return final count as number of digits | output: 3 |

Here are well-organized **notes** on determining if a number is a palindrome, based on the transcript.

## Problem Statement

- Given a number **n**, check if it is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forward and backward).
- The number **n** is always **greater than or equal to zero**.


## Palindrome Definition

- A **palindrome number** is one whose digits are identical when read forwards and backwards.
    - Example: 78987 and 8668 are palindromes because their reverses are identical to themselves.
    - Any **single-digit number** is always a palindrome.
    - For example, 21 is **not** a palindrome (reverse is 12), and 367 is **not** a palindrome (reverse is 763).


## Approach and Algorithm

- **Core Idea:** Find the reverse of the given number and check if it equals the original number.
- If the reverse equals the original, **return true**; else, **return false**.


### Steps to Find Reverse

- Initialize `reverse = 0` and create `temp = n` to avoid modifying the original number.
- While `temp > 0`:
    - Get the last digit: `last_digit = temp % 10`
    - Update the reversed number: `reverse = reverse * 10 + last_digit`
    - Remove the last digit from `temp`: `temp = temp // 10`
- After the loop, compare `reverse` and `n`.


### Example Walkthrough

- For **n = 367**:
    - Reverse computation: 7 → 76 → 763
    - Since 763 ≠ 367, not a palindrome.
- For **n = 363**:
    - Reverse computation: 3 → 36 → 363
    - Since 363 = 363, it is a palindrome.
- For **n = 4553**:
    - Reverse computation: 3 → 35 → 355 → 3554
    - Since 3554 ≠ 4553, not a palindrome.


## Implementation Notes

- The algorithm works similarly in both **C++** and **Java** (use `boolean` in Java and `bool` in C++).
- It’s important to use a separate variable (`temp`) to preserve the original number for the final comparison.
- The function should take `n` as input and return a **boolean** indicating palindrome status.


## Time Complexity

- Each digit is processed once, so the total time complexity is **Θ(d)**, where **d** is the number of digits in the number.

***

### Palindrome Check: Code Logic Reference

| Step | Operation | Example (n=367) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Initialize | reverse = 0, temp = n | reverse = 0, temp = 367 |
| Last digit | last_digit = temp % 10 | last_digit = 7 |
| Update rev | reverse = reverse * 10 + last_digit | reverse = 7 |
| Remove digit | temp = temp // 10 | temp = 36 |
| Repeat | Steps above until temp == 0 | ... |
| Compare | reverse == n ? palindrome : not | reverse = 763 ≠ 367 |

Here are detailed **notes** covering the factorial problem, including both iterative and recursive solutions.

## Problem Statement

- Given a **number n**, compute the **factorial of n**.
- The **factorial** of n (denoted as \$ n! \$) is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to n.
- Defined for all \$ n \ge 0 \$. By definition, \$ 0! = 1 \$ and \$ 1! = 1 \$.


## Examples

- For \$ n = 4 \$: \$ 4! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24 \$.
- For \$ n = 6 \$: \$ 6! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6 = 720 \$.
- For \$ n = 0 \$ or \$ n = 1 \$: factorial is 1.


## Iterative Solution

### Algorithm

- Initialize **result** to 1.
- Loop from 2 to n, multiplying **result** by each i in the range.
- Return **result** at the end.


### Example (n = 5)

- Step-by-step:
    - Result = 1 (initial)
    - Multiply by 2 → Result = 2
    - Multiply by 3 → Result = 6
    - Multiply by 4 → Result = 24
    - Multiply by 5 → Result = 120


### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \$ Θ(n) \$ — loop runs n-1 times.
- **Auxiliary Space:** \$ O(1) \$ — only a constant number of variables used.


## Recursive Solution

### Algorithm

- If \$ n = 0 \$, return 1 (base case).
- Otherwise, return \$ n \times factorial(n-1) \$.


### Example (n = 5)

- Call \$ factorial(5) \$:
    - Calls \$ 5 \times factorial(4) \$
    - Which calls \$ 4 \times factorial(3) \$
    - Continue until \$ factorial(0) \$, which returns 1
    - Then multiply back up: \$ 1 \times 1 = 1, 2 \times 1 = 2, 3 \times 2 = 6, 4 \times 6 = 24, 5 \times 24 = 120 \$


### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \$ Θ(n) \$ — n+1 calls, each does constant work.
- **Auxiliary Space:** \$ Θ(n) \$ — due to n+1 function calls on the call stack.


### Other Notes

- The **iterative solution** is generally better due to lower space usage and no recursive call overhead.
- The **recursive solution** is clear and matches the mathematical definition, but not space-efficient.

***

### Table: Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time Complexity | Auxiliary Space | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Iterative | \$ Θ(n) \$ | \$ O(1) \$ | Preferred for efficiency |
| Recursive | \$ Θ(n) \$ | \$ Θ(n) \$ | Simple, but uses more stack space |

Here are detailed **notes** on counting trailing zeros in the factorial of a number, including both naive and efficient methods.

## Problem Statement

- Given a number **n**, find the number of **trailing zeros in \$ n! \$** (the factorial of n).
- Example: For \$ n = 5 \$, \$ 5! = 120 \$ (1 trailing zero). For \$ n = 10 \$, \$ 10! = 3628800 \$ (2 trailing zeros).
- For \$ n = 100 \$, the answer is 24 trailing zeros.


## Naive Solution

### Approach

- Compute \$ n! \$ by multiplying all numbers from 1 to n.
- Repeatedly divide the result by 10 to count trailing zeros until the result is no longer divisible by 10.
- Return the count.


### Drawbacks

- **Time complexity:** \$ Θ(n) \$ due to the loop computing factorial.
- **Major issue:** Factorials grow very fast; for moderate n (like n = 20), the result may cause integer overflow, making this approach impractical for large values.


## Efficient Solution ("Counting Fives")

### Mathematical Insight

- A trailing zero in a number results from multiplying a factor of **2** and a factor of **5** (since \$ 2 \times 5 = 10 \$).
- There are always more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, so the number of trailing zeros depends on the number of times **5** appears in the prime factorization of \$ n! \$.


### Algorithm

- **Count the number of times 5 divides numbers up to n:** for every multiple of 5, 25, 125, etc., count how many multiples appear.
- For example, count \$ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor \$, \$ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor \$, \$ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor \$, and so on, until the factor exceeds n.


#### Formula:

$$
\text{trailing\_zeros}(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \ldots
$$

### Example (n = 251)

- \$ 251 \div 5 = 50 \$
- \$ 251 \div 25 = 10 \$
- \$ 251 \div 125 = 2 \$
- Sum: \$ 50 + 10 + 2 = 62 \$ trailing zeros.


### Implementation

- Initialize result = 0, i = 5.
- While \$ i \le n \$, add \$ n \div i \$ (integer division) to result.
- Multiply i by 5 each time.
- Stop when i exceeds n.


### Time Complexity

- Each iteration multiplies i by 5, so total iterations are about \$ \log_5 n \$.
- **Time complexity:** \$ Θ(\log n) \$, which is much faster and avoids overflow since it never calculates the actual factorial.


## Summary Table

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space | Overflow Risk | Concept |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Naive | \$ Θ(n) \$ | O(1) | High | Computes factorial explicitly |
| Efficient (Fives) | \$ Θ(\log n) \$ | O(1) | None | Counts factors of 5 only |

Here are organized **notes** on the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) problem, including conceptual explanations, methods, and algorithmic details.

## Problem Statement

- Given two integers **a** and **b**, find their **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** — the largest integer dividing both without a remainder.
- Example: $a = 4, b = 6 \rightarrow \mathrm{GCD} = 2$; $a = 100, b = 200 \rightarrow \mathrm{GCD} = 100$.


## Key Concepts

- GCD is also called the **greatest common factor** or **highest common factor (HCF)**.
- If two numbers share no common divisors except 1, their GCD is 1 (they are "coprime" but not necessarily prime themselves).
- GCD has a geometric interpretation: For a rectangle of size **a × b**, the GCD is the largest square tile that can completely tile the rectangle.


## Naive Approach

- Start at **min(a, b)** and check downward to 1 for the highest number that divides both.
- Steps:
    - For all $d$ from $\min(a, b)$ down to 1:
        - If $d$ divides both a and b, GCD is $d$.
- **Time complexity:** $O(\min(a, b))$, as it checks every possible divisor.


## Euclidean Algorithm (Efficient Approach)

### Principle

- The GCD doesn’t change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller.
- That is, $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a - b, b)$, and the result holds recursively.


### Subtraction-Based Version

- While $a \ne b$:
    - Replace the larger by the difference: $a = a - b$ or $b = b - a$
- When $a = b$, that’s GCD.


### Optimized Version (Modulo-Based Euclidean)

- Uses modulo to avoid many repeated subtractions.
- **Recursive formula:**

$$
\gcd(a, b) = 
  \begin{cases}
    a & \text{if } b = 0 \\
    \gcd(b, a \bmod b) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
$$
- Handles a and b in any order: a recursive call will swap them as needed.


### Example (a = 12, b = 15)

1. $\gcd(12, 15) \rightarrow \gcd(15, 12)$
2. $\gcd(15, 12) \rightarrow \gcd(12, 15 \bmod 12 = 3)$
3. $\gcd(12, 3) \rightarrow \gcd(3, 12 \bmod 3 = 0)$
4. $\gcd(3, 0) = 3$ (final answer).

### Advantages

- **Time complexity:** $O(\log \min(a, b))$ — much faster for large numbers.
- Requires only constant space if written iteratively; $O(\log n)$ stack space if implemented recursively.


## Table: Comparison of GCD Methods

| Method | Time Complexity | Auxiliary Space | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Naive iterative | $O(\min(a, b))$ | $O(1)$ | Checks all divisors |
| Euclidean (subtraction) | $O(\max(a, b))$ | $O(1)$ | Repeated subtraction |
| Euclidean (modulo/recursive) | $O(\log \min(a, b))$ | $O(\log \min(a, b))$ | Standard, very fast |

## Additional Notes

- Euclidean algorithm is the gold standard for computing GCD efficiently and forms the basis for algorithms in number theory and cryptography.

Here are detailed **notes** on the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, covering definitions, examples, naive and efficient solutions.

## Problem Statement

- Given two numbers **a** and **b**, find their **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** — the smallest positive integer divisible by both a and b.
- Examples:
    - $a=4, b=6 \Rightarrow \mathrm{LCM} = 12$ (smallest number divisible by both)
    - $a=12, b=15 \Rightarrow \mathrm{LCM} = 60$
    - If one number divides the other (e.g., 2 and 8), LCM is the larger number.
    - If $a$ and $b$ are coprime (no common factors), LCM is their product.


## Naive Solution

- Start searching from $\max(a, b)$ upwards.
- Check each number whether it is divisible by both a and b.
- Return the first such number found.
- Example: For a=4, b=6, start at 6 and check: 6 (no), 7 (no), ... until 12 (yes).


### Pseudocode

- result = max(a, b)
- Loop indefinitely:
    - If result % a == 0 and result % b == 0, return result
    - Else, increment result


### Time Complexity

- Worst case roughly $O(a \times b - \max(a,b))$, which can be very large and inefficient.


## Efficient Solution

### Relationship with GCD

- Use the formula:

$$
\mathrm{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\mathrm{GCD}(a, b)}
$$

- Compute GCD using Euclidean algorithm (efficiently covered before).
- Calculate LCM by dividing product by GCD.


### Example

- For $a=4, b=6$:
    - $\mathrm{GCD}(4,6)=2$
    - $\mathrm{LCM} = \frac{4 \times 6}{2} = 12$.


### Time Complexity

- Time complexity dominated by GCD calculation: $O(\log \min(a, b))$.
- Multiplications and division are constant time.
- Overall time complexity: **logarithmic**, much better than naive method.


## Summary Table

| Approach | Time Complexity | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Naive | $O(a \times b)$ | Inefficient for large inputs |
| Efficient (GCD-based) | $O(\log \min(a,b))$ | Uses GCD for fast calculation |


***

### Additional Notes

- LCM is useful in problems involving synchronizing cycles, scheduling, and number theory.
- Always use the GCD-based approach for practical efficiency.

Here are comprehensive **notes** on checking if a number is prime, including naive, optimized, and further efficient approaches.

## Problem Statement

- Given an integer \$ n \$, determine if it is a **prime number** or not.
- A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Examples:
    - 13 is prime (divisible by 1 and 13 only)
    - 14 is not prime (divisible by 1, 2, 7, 14)
    - 10 is not prime (divisible by 1, 2, 5, 10)
- Note: 2 is the only even prime; 1 is neither prime nor composite.


## Naive Method

- Check divisibility of \$ n \$ by all integers from 2 up to \$ n-1 \$.
- If any divisor divides \$ n \$, \$ n \$ is not prime.
- If no divisor found, \$ n \$ is prime.
- Worst-case time complexity: \$ O(n) \$ (checks almost all numbers for prime inputs).


## Optimized Method Using Divisor Pairs and Square Root

- Divisors appear in pairs \$ (x, y) \$ such that \$ x \times y = n \$.
- One of each divisor pair must be less than or equal to \$ \sqrt{n} \$.
- Check divisibility only up to \$ \sqrt{n} \$.
- If no divisor found till \$ \sqrt{n} \$, then \$ n \$ is prime.
- Time complexity: \$ O(\sqrt{n}) \$, a significant improvement over naive.


## Further Optimized Method

- Special cases:
    - Return false if \$ n = 1 \$ (not prime)
    - Return true if \$ n = 2 \$ or \$ 3 \$ (prime)
- Check if \$ n \$ is divisible by 2 or 3:
    - If divisible, \$ n \$ is not prime.
- For numbers greater than 3, check divisibility using increments of 6:
    - Start with \$ i = 5 \$,
    - Check divisibility by \$ i \$ and \$ i + 2 \$ (numbers of the form \$ 6k \pm 1 \$ cover all primes),
    - Increment \$ i \$ by 6 each iteration,
    - Continue while \$ i \times i \leq n \$.
- This skips multiples of 2 and 3 inside the loop, greatly reducing iterations.
- Time complexity remains \$ O(\sqrt{n}) \$, but runtime improves with fewer checks.


## Example Walkthrough

- For \$ n = 121 \$:
    - Not divisible by 2 or 3,
    - Check dividing by 5 and 7 — no,
    - Check dividing by 11 (since \$ 11 \times 11 = 121 \$), yes, divisible → not prime.
- For \$ n = 1031 \$:
    - Not divisible by 2 or 3,
    - Check divisibility by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31 (all ≤ \$ \sqrt{1031} \approx 32 \$),
    - None divides 1031 → prime.


## Summary Table

| Method | Checks Range | Time Complexity | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Naive | 2 to \$ n-1 \$ | \$ O(n) \$ | Slow for large \$ n \$ |
| Square Root Optimized | 2 to \$ \sqrt{n} \$ | \$ O(\sqrt{n}) \$ | Much faster than naive |
| 6k ± 1 Optimization | Checks divisors in form | \$ O(\sqrt{n}) \$ | Skips multiples of 2 and 3, fewer iterations |


***

This approach reduces redundant checks and improves efficiency in prime checking for large inputs.

Here are detailed **notes** on printing prime factors of a given number \$ n \$, covering definitions, naive and efficient solutions, examples, and time complexity.

## Problem Statement

- Given an integer \$ n \$, print its **prime factors**.
- Prime factors are **prime divisors** of \$ n \$, possibly repeated according to their powers.
- Example:
    - \$ n=12 \$ → prime factors are $2, 2, 3$
    - \$ n=13 \$ → prime factor is only $13$ (since 13 is prime)
    - \$ n=450 \$ → prime factors are $2, 3, 3, 5, 5$


## Naive Solution

- For each number \$ i \$ from 2 to \$ n-1 \$:
    - Check if \$ i \$ is prime.
    - If prime, check if \$ i \$ divides \$ n \$.
    - Extract all powers of \$ i \$ dividing \$ n \$ and print \$ i \$ repeatedly.
- Uses a helper prime checking function (which itself can be \$ O(n) \$ or more).
- Time complexity:
    - Outer loop runs \$ O(n) \$,
    - Prime check per iteration \$ O(n) \$,
    - Inner loop dividing powers: up to \$ O(\log n) \$,
    - Overall upper bound: \$ O(n^2 \log n) \$, inefficient for large \$ n \$.


## Efficient Solution (Based on Divisor Pairs and Prime Factorization)

- Leverages that divisors come in pairs, with one member \$ \leq \sqrt{n} \$.
- Steps:

1. Handle small prime factors 2 and 3 explicitly:
        - Remove all powers of 2 (keep dividing \$ n \$ and print 2),
        - Remove all powers of 3 similarly.
2. For \$ i \$ ranging from 5 to \$ \sqrt{n} \$, incrementing by 6:
        - Check divisibility by \$ i \$ and \$ i+2 \$ (i.e., numbers of form $6k \pm 1$),
        - Remove powers from \$ n \$ and print factors.
3. After loop, if \$ n > 3 \$, \$ n \$ itself is prime; print \$ n \$.
- This method extracts prime factors efficiently without redundant prime checks.


## Example Walkthrough (n = 450)

- Remove factors of 2: \$ 450/2 = 225 \$, print 2 once.
- Remove factors of 3: $225/3=75$, print 3; repeat: $75/3=25$, print 3 again.
- Loop increments \$ i = 5, 11, 17, ··· \$:
    - \$ 25/5=5 \$, print 5; $5/5=1$, print 5 again.
- Remaining \$ n = 1 \$, stop.


## Time Complexity

- Worst case when \$ n \$ is prime: loop runs \$ O(\sqrt{n}) \$ times (inner while loops do not execute).
- For composite numbers, inner loops reduce \$ n \$ quickly, optimizing average case further.
- Overall: \$ O(\sqrt{n}) \$ time complexity.


## Summary Table

| Approach | Time Complexity | Key Idea |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Naive | $O(n^2 \log n)$ | Checks all $i$ with prime checks |
| Efficient (Divisor Pairs) | $O(\sqrt{n})$ | Removes prime factors up to \$ \sqrt{n} \$, handles 2 and 3 specially |


***

This approach efficiently computes and prints all prime factors with their powers for moderate to large \$ n \$, using divisor pairs and prime factorization principles .

Here are detailed **notes** on printing all divisors of a given number \$ n \$, including naive and efficient solutions, examples, and time complexity.

## Problem Statement

- Given a number \$ n \$, print all its divisors in **increasing order**.
- Divisors are numbers that divide \$ n \$ completely (no remainder).
- Examples:
    - For \$ n=15 \$, divisors are \$ 1, 3, 5, 15 \$.
    - For \$ n=100 \$, divisors are \$ 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 \$.
    - For prime numbers, only two divisors: 1 and the number itself.


## Naive Solution

- Loop from 1 to \$ n \$.
- Check if \$ i \$ divides \$ n \$.
- Print \$ i \$ if it divides.
- Time Complexity: \$ \Theta(n) \$ and uses constant auxiliary space.
- Inefficient for large \$ n \$ since it checks all numbers up to \$ n \$.


## Efficient Solution Using Divisor Pairs

- Divisors always come in **pairs** \$ (x, y) \$ such that \$ x \times y = n \$.
- Among each pair, one divisor is always $\leq \sqrt{n}$ (the smaller one in the pair).
- Only iterate from 1 to $\sqrt{n}$, yielding one divisor of each pair.
- Print the calculated divisor and its paired divisor \$ \frac{n}{i} \$.
- For perfect squares (e.g., 25), avoid printing the divisor twice by checking if \$ i = \frac{n}{i} \$.


### Implementation Details

- Loop \$ i \$ from 1 to \$ \sqrt{n} \$:
    - If \$ i \$ divides \$ n \$, print \$ i \$.
    - If \$ i \neq \frac{n}{i} \$, also print \$ \frac{n}{i} \$.


### Example for 25

- Loop from 1 to 5:
    - \$ i=1 \$ divides 25 → print 1 and 25.
    - \$ i=2,3,4 \$ do not divide.
    - \$ i=5 \$ divides 25 → print 5 only once (since \$ 5 = \frac{25}{5} \$).


### Issue with Ordering

- This method prints smaller divisors first, but paired larger divisors later in no guaranteed order, so output is unordered.


## Printing Divisors in Sorted Order

- Use two loops:

1. From 1 to \$ \sqrt{n} \$, print all divisors \$ i \$.
2. From \$ \sqrt{n} \$ down to 1, print stored paired divisors \$ \frac{n}{i} \$ (only if distinct from \$ i \$).
- This method ensures all divisors printed in increasing sorted order.


## Time Complexity

- Both loops run \$ \Theta(\sqrt{n}) \$ times.
- Overall time complexity: \$ \Theta(\sqrt{n}) \$, which is efficient compared to naive.


## Auxiliary Space

- \$ \Theta(1) \$ if printing immediately, or \$ \Theta(\sqrt{n}) \$ if storing for ordering.

***

This approach provides a time-efficient way to list all divisors sorted, crucial for large \$ n \$ where naive solutions are expensive.

Here are detailed **notes** on finding all prime numbers up to a given number \$ n \$, covering naive and optimized algorithms, implementation, and complexity.

## Problem Statement

- Given a number \$ n \$, print all prime numbers smaller than or equal to \$ n \$.
- Prime numbers have only two divisors: 1 and themselves.
- Examples:
    - For \$ n=10 \$, primes are 2, 3, 5, 7
    - For \$ n=23 \$, primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23


## Naive Solution

- Run a loop from 2 to \$ n \$.
- For each number, check using an `isPrime()` function if it is prime.
- Print if prime.
- **Time complexity:**
    - Checking primality for one number: $O(\sqrt{n})$
    - For all numbers up to \$ n \$: $O(n \sqrt{n})$ — inefficient for large \$ n \$.


## Optimized Solution: Sieve of Eratosthenes

### Key Idea

- Create a boolean array `isPrime` of size \$ n+1 \$, initialized to true (except for index 0 and 1).
- Start from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$:
    - If `isPrime[i]` is true, mark all multiples of \$ i \$ (starting from \$ i^2 \$) as false.
- Remaining true entries are primes.


### Why start from \$ i^2 \$?

- Multiples smaller than \$ i^2 \$ are already marked by smaller primes.
- For example, multiples of 2 and 3 mark 4, 6, 8, 9, etc.


### How it works

- For \$ n=9 \$:
    - Mark multiples of 2 (4, 6, 8) false
    - Mark multiples of 3 (6, 9) false
    - Remaining true at indices 2, 3, 5, 7 indicate primes


### Implementation Notes

- Efficient in both time and space.
- After marking, iterate through array and print indices marked true.


## Time Complexity and Performance

- Time complexity: $O(n \log \log n)$ — almost linear.
- \$ \log \log n \$ factor grows very slowly, making sieve very efficient.
- Much better than naive \$ O(n \sqrt{n}) \$ solution.

***

This sieve algorithm is a classic and efficient method to list primes up to a large number \$ n \$, significantly reducing computation time compared to naive checks while maintaining clarity and ease of implementation .

Here are detailed **notes** on computing \$ x^n \$ (power function), including naive and efficient recursive approaches, example, and complexity.

## Problem Statement

- Given two numbers \$ x \$ and \$ n \$, compute \$ x^n \$ (x raised to the power n).
- Examples:
    - \$ 2^3 = 8 \$
    - \$ 3^4 = 81 \$
    - \$ x^0 = 1 \$
    - \$ x^1 = x \$


## Naive Solution

- Initialize result as 1.
- Multiply result by \$ x \$ repeatedly \$ n \$ times.
- Time Complexity: \$ \Theta(n) \$ due to \$ n \$ multiplications.


## Efficient Recursive Solution (Exponentiation by Squaring)

### Idea

- Use the identity:
    - If \$ n \$ is even:

$$
x^n = (x^{n/2}) \times (x^{n/2})
$$
    - If \$ n \$ is odd:

$$
x^n = (x^{n-1}) \times x
$$
- Compute \$ x^{n/2} \$ recursively once and reuse it to get \$ x^n \$.


### Implementation Highlights

- Base cases:
    - \$ n=0 \$ returns 1.
    - \$ n=1 \$ returns \$ x \$.
- Recursively compute \$ x^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \$ as `temp`.
- Result = `temp * temp`.
- If \$ n \$ is odd, multiply result by \$ x \$.


### Example Walkthrough

- Compute \$ 3^5 \$:
    - Compute \$ 3^{2} \$, which computes \$ 3^{1} = 3 \$.
    - \$ 3^{2} = 3 * 3 = 9 \$.
    - Since 5 is odd, multiply \$ 9 * 9 * 3 = 243 \$.


## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: \$ \Theta(\log n) \$, reduces multiplications exponentially.
- Auxiliary Space: \$ \Theta(\log n) \$ due to recursion call stack height.


## Additional Notes

- Recursive calls add overhead; iterative solutions can achieve \$ \Theta(\log n) \$ time with \$ O(1) \$ space.
- Exponentiation by squaring is widely used in modular exponentiation and cryptography due to efficiency.

This method efficiently computes powers with logarithmic complexity, significantly better than naive repeated multiplication for large exponents .

Here are detailed **notes** on the iterative solution for computing \$ x^n \$ (power), emphasizing efficiency and auxiliary space.

## Problem Statement

- Compute \$ x^n \$ for given \$ x \$ and \$ n \$ using an **iterative** algorithm.
- Goals: time complexity \$ \Theta(\log n) \$, auxiliary space \$ O(1) \$.


## Key Idea

- Every integer \$ n \$ can be represented as a sum of powers of two, related to its binary representation.
- Example:
    - \$ 10 = 8 + 2 = 2^3 + 2^1 \$
    - \$ 19 = 16 + 2 + 1 = 2^4 + 2^1 + 2^0 \$
- Iterate through the bits of \$ n \$ from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB).
- For each bit that is 1, multiply the result by \$ x^{2^{bit\_position}} \$.


## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize `result = 1`.
2. Traverse bits of \$ n \$:
    - If current bit (least significant) is 1, multiply `result` by current \$ x \$.
    - Square \$ x \$ to get next power \$ x^{2^i} \$.
    - Shift \$ n \$ right by one (integer division by 2) to process next bit.
3. Continue until all bits are processed.
4. Return `result`.

## Example Walkthrough: Compute \$ 4^5 \$

- Binary representation of 5: 101
- Iteration 1 (bit 0): bit=1 → result = 1*4=4; \$ x = 4^2=16 \$; \$ n=2 \$.
- Iteration 2 (bit 1): bit=0 → skip multiply; \$ x = 16^2=256 \$; \$ n=1 \$.
- Iteration 3 (bit 2): bit=1 → result = 4*256=1024; \$ x = 256^2 \$ (not needed); \$ n=0 \$.
- Final result = 1024.


## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: \$ \Theta(\log n) \$ (number of bits in \$ n \$).
- Auxiliary Space: \$ O(1) \$ — iterative, no recursion stack.


## Additional Optimizations

- Use **bitwise operations** to check bits and shift:
    - Check if \$ n \& 1 \$ is 1 (bit is set).
    - Use \$ n = n >> 1 \$ to shift \$ n \$.
- For very large \$ x^n \$, use long long (C++) or long (Java) types.
- To avoid overflow, compute under modulo \$ m \$ by applying modulo after each multiplication, i.e.,

$$
\text{result} = (\text{result} \times x) \mod m
$$

and

$$
x = (x \times x) \mod m
$$
