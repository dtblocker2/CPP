# 📘 Notes on **Best, Average, and Worst Case Analysis**

### 🔹 Example Function: Array Sum

* Function takes:

  * Array as input
  * Size of array
* Computes sum by traversing the array.
* Time function:

  $$
  T(n) = C_1n + C_2
  $$
* **Order of Growth:** $O(n)$ (linear).

---

### 🔹 Modified Example

* If **array size is even** → return **0** (constant time).
* If **array size is odd** → compute sum (linear time).

👉 Order of growth depends on input type.
So, we categorize into **best, average, and worst cases**.

---

### 🔹 Definitions

#### 1. **Best Case**

* **Minimum order of growth** possible.
* Example: Even-sized array → $O(1)$.
* ⚠️ Rarely used in practice → doesn’t provide useful guarantees.

---

#### 2. **Average Case**

* **Expected time** across all inputs.
* Computed as:

  $$
  \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of time for all inputs}}{\text{Number of inputs}}
  $$
* Often requires **assumptions** about input distribution.
* Example assumption: Half inputs are even-sized (O(1)), half are odd-sized (O(n)).
* Simplifies to → **O(n)**.
* ⚠️ Problem: Hard to know real input distribution, so often not practical.

---

#### 3. **Worst Case**

* **Maximum order of growth** across all inputs.
* Example: Odd-sized array → $O(n)$.
* ✅ Most commonly used → guarantees performance **in the worst scenario**.
* Often used as **time complexity of algorithm**.

---

### 🔹 When Cases Differ

* Example: **Insertion Sort**

  * Sorted input → $O(n)$ (best).
  * Reverse sorted input → $O(n^2)$ (worst).

---

### 🔹 When Cases Don’t Differ

* Example: Finding **maximum or minimum** in an array.
* Always requires full traversal → **O(n)** for all cases (no best/worst/average distinction).

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

1. **Best Case** → minimum time, usually ignored.
2. **Average Case** → expected time, desirable but often impractical.
3. **Worst Case** → maximum time, most important in analysis.
4. If algorithm’s time **doesn’t vary by input type**, just one complexity (e.g., sum or max in array).
5. If time **varies by input type** → analyze using **best, average, worst** cases.

Here’s a **well-organized summary** of the transcript on **Asymptotic Notations**:

---

# 📘 Notes on **Asymptotic Notations**

### 🔹 Purpose

* Used to mathematically **represent the order of growth** of an algorithm’s time/space complexity.
* Help compare algorithms **independent of machine, compiler, or constant factors**.

---

### 🔹 Three Popular Notations

1. **Big-O (O)** → **Upper bound**

   * Represents **worst-case or at most** growth.
   * Means: algorithm takes **that much time or less**.
   * Example:

     $$
     C_1n + C_2 = O(n)
     $$

     Can also be written as $O(n^2)$, since **any higher order** also works as an upper bound.

---

2. **Theta (Θ)** → **Tight/Exact bound**

   * Represents **exact order of growth** (both upper and lower).
   * Useful when algorithm’s growth is **precisely known**.
   * Example:

     $$
     C_1n^2 + C_2\log n + C_3 = \Theta(n^2)
     $$

---

3. **Omega (Ω)** → **Lower bound**

   * Represents **best-case or at least** growth.
   * Means: algorithm takes **that much time or more**.
   * Example: Linear search best case → $\Omega(1)$.

---

### 🔹 Example: **Linear Search**

* Input: Array + element X.
* Behavior:

  * If X found at **first position** → constant time $O(1)$.
  * If X not present → traverses whole array → linear time $O(n)$.

➡ Complexity description:

* **Best case**: $\Omega(1)$
* **Worst case**: $O(n)$
* **Theta**: $\Theta(n)$ (only if specifying worst-case explicitly).

---

### 🔹 Key Points About Notations

* **Big-O**:

  * Always allows higher bounds.
  * If algorithm is $O(n)$, it can also be written as $O(n^2)$, $O(n^3)$, etc. (but less precise).
  * Most commonly used → because we care about the **upper limit** (guarantee).

* **Theta (Θ)**:

  * Stronger than Big-O.
  * Provides **exact growth rate**.
  * Example: Insertion sort worst-case → $Θ(n^2)$.

* **Omega (Ω)**:

  * Represents **lower bound**.
  * Example: Linear search best case → $Ω(1)$.
  * Rarely used in practice, since algorithm analysis usually focuses on **worst-case guarantees**.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

1. **Big-O (O)** → Upper bound (worst-case or “at most”).
2. **Theta (Θ)** → Exact bound (tight growth rate).
3. **Omega (Ω)** → Lower bound (best-case or “at least”).
4. In practice:

   * **Big-O** and **Theta** are widely used.
   * **Omega** is less useful, since worst-case analysis is usually more important.

Here’s a **well-structured summary** of your transcript on **Big-O Notation**:

---

# 📘 Notes on **Big-O Notation**

### 🔹 Purpose

* Represents **upper bound** (worst-case or at most growth).
* Sometimes written for **exact order**, but if exact is known → prefer **Θ (Theta)**.
* Commonly used when:

  * Complexity varies with input.
  * Only worst-case matters.
  * Exact growth is difficult to determine.

---

### 🔹 Direct Method (Finding Big-O from Expression)

1. Identify the **highest-order term**.
2. Ignore **lower-order terms** and **constants**.
3. Write the result in Big-O form.

✅ Examples:

* $3n^2 + 5n + 2 = O(n^2)$
* $7n \log n + 2n = O(n \log n)$
* Constants (100, 5000, etc.) → $O(1)$.

---

### 🔹 Mathematical Definition

A function $f(n)$ is **O(g(n))** if:

$$
f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n), \quad \forall n \geq n_0
$$

* $c$ → constant multiplier
* $n_0$ → threshold after which the inequality always holds

✅ Example:

* $f(n) = 2n + 3$
* Choose $c = 3$, $n_0 = 3$.
* Proves $f(n) = O(n)$.

---

### 🔹 Examples of Big-O Classes

* **O(1):** Constant time (e.g., accessing array element).
* **O(log n):** Logarithmic (binary search).
* **O(n):** Linear (traversing array).
* **O(n log n):** Sorting algorithms like Merge Sort.
* **O(n²):** Nested loops (e.g., Bubble Sort).
* **O(2^n):** Recursive algorithms (e.g., subset generation).
* **O(n!):** Factorial growth (e.g., brute-force permutations).

---

### 🔹 Multiple Variables

* For $100n^2 + 1000m$ → $O(n^2 + m)$.
* For $mn + m^2$ → $O(mn + m^2)$.

---

### 🔹 Applications of Big-O

* Useful when:

  * **Exact bound is unknown or variable** (preferable over Θ).
  * Algorithm has **complex conditions** and worst-case analysis is easier.
* Standard practice:

  1. Find **innermost statement** (executed most).
  2. Estimate **max number of executions**.
  3. Express in **Big-O**.

---

### 🔹 Example: Prime Check Algorithm

* Input: number $n$.
* Handles small cases (1, 2, 3).
* Checks divisibility by 2 or 3 (constant time).
* Otherwise → checks divisors up to $\sqrt{n}$, skipping multiples of 2 & 3.
* **Worst case:** $O(\sqrt{n})$.
* Many inputs stop earlier, but Big-O safely covers **all cases**.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

1. **Big-O = Upper bound** → worst-case guarantee.
2. Always ignore **constants** and **lower-order terms**.
3. Use **Θ** when exact bound is known.
4. Constants → $O(1)$.
5. Complex algorithms → use **worst-case Big-O analysis**.

Here’s a **clear, structured summary** of your transcript on **Big Omega (Ω) Notation**:

---

# 📘 Notes on **Big Omega (Ω) Notation**

### 🔹 Purpose

* **Opposite of Big-O.**
* Represents a **lower bound** (best case or at least this much time).
* Used when we want to guarantee the **minimum work** an algorithm must perform.

---

### 🔹 Examples

1. **Online Game Example**

   * $n$ players. Game runs indefinitely.
   * No upper bound (could run forever).
   * But at least **initialization of scores** requires $Ω(n)$.

2. **Permutations Example**

   * A string of length $n$ → $n!$ permutations.
   * Any algorithm must **at least** print all permutations.
   * So complexity: $Ω(n!)$.

---

### 🔹 Mathematical Definition

A function $f(n)$ is **Ω(g(n))** if:

$$
f(n) \geq c \cdot g(n), \quad \forall n \geq n_0
$$

* $c > 0$, $n_0 \geq 0$.
* Same setup as Big-O, but inequality is **reversed**.
* Focus: **large $n$ values** (asymptotic behavior).

---

### 🔹 Direct Method (Quick Way to Find Ω)

1. **Ignore lower-order terms**.
2. **Ignore constants** of leading term.
3. Result is Ω of the **highest-order term**.

✅ Examples:

* $f(n) = 2n + 3$ → $Ω(n)$.
* $f(n) = 5n^2 + 4n + 6$ → $Ω(n^2)$.
* In Ω, **smaller bounds also valid**:

  * $2n + 3 = Ω(n)$, but also $Ω(1), Ω(\log n)$.
  * Prefer **tightest lower bound** for usefulness.

---

### 🔹 Graphical View

* In **Big-O**, curve $c \cdot g(n)$ lies **above** $f(n)$ after some $n_0$.
* In **Ω**, curve $c \cdot g(n)$ lies **below** $f(n)$ after some $n_0$.

---

### 🔹 Key Facts

1. If $f(n) = Θ(g(n))$, then it’s both $O(g(n))$ and $Ω(g(n))$.
2. **Big-O allows higher-order bounds** (looser).

   * Example: $n^2$ can be $O(n^3)$.
3. **Big-Ω allows lower-order bounds**.

   * Example: $n^2$ can be $Ω(n)$, $Ω(1)$.
4. Any algorithm has at least $Ω(1)$ (constant time).
5. **Duality:**

   * If $f(n) = O(g(n))$, then $g(n) = Ω(f(n))$.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

* **Big-Ω = lower bound** (best case or minimum guarantee).
* Direct method: keep **dominant term**, ignore constants.
* Often less practical than Big-O (since best case is rare), but useful in **theoretical proofs**.
* Exact growth is expressed with **Θ**, not Ω.

---

⚡ Do you want me to also create a **side-by-side comparison chart (Big-O vs Θ vs Ω: definition, inequality, graph, examples, usage)** for quick revision?

Here’s a **well-structured summary** of your transcript on **Theta (Θ) Notation**:

---

# 📘 Notes on **Theta (Θ) Notation**

### 🔹 Purpose

* Represents the **exact bound** (tight bound) of a function or algorithm.
* Prefer Θ when you know the **precise growth rate** (not just upper or lower).
* Gives **best information** about algorithm’s order of growth.

---

### 🔹 Relation to Other Notations

* **Big-O** → upper bound (may be loose).
* **Big-Ω** → lower bound.
* **Theta (Θ)** → combination of both:

  $$
  c_1 g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2 g(n), \quad \forall n \geq n_0
  $$
* Requires two constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$.

---

### 🔹 Key Condition

* **Bounding from both sides is possible only if $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ have the same order of growth**.
* Otherwise, one side cannot hold as $n \to \infty$.

---

### 🔹 Example: $f(n) = 2n + 3$

* From **Big-O**: found $c = 3$.
* From **Ω**: found $c = 1$.
* So in Θ:

  $$
  n \leq 2n+3 \leq 3n, \quad \forall n \geq 3
  $$
* Constants: $c_1 = 1, c_2 = 3, n_0 = 3$.
* Conclusion: $f(n) = Θ(n)$.

---

### 🔹 Direct Method (Shortcut)

1. Ignore **lower-order terms**.
2. Ignore **constant factors**.
3. The **dominant term** = Θ of that term.

✅ Examples:

* $5n^2 + 3n + 10 = Θ(n^2)$.
* $7n^3 + n^2 = Θ(n^3)$.
* $n + \log n = Θ(n)$.

---

### 🔹 Facts About Θ

1. If $f(n) = Θ(g(n))$, then:

   * $f(n) = O(g(n))$
   * $f(n) = Ω(g(n))$
   * and vice versa.
2. Θ means **tight bound**: exact growth.
3. Example:

   * $f(n) = 2n^2 + n$
   * $Θ(n^2)$, but also $O(n^2)$ and $Ω(n^2)$.

---

### 🔹 Why Θ is Preferred

* Provides **precise information**.
* Example:

  * **Max/Min in array** → must traverse entire array → $Θ(n)$.
  * If written as $O(n)$, it suggests “could be less,” which is misleading.
* **Insertion Sort**:

  * Best case → $Θ(n)$.
  * Worst case → $Θ(n^2)$.
  * General complexity → $O(n^2)$ (covers both).

---

### 🔹 Examples of Θ Classes

* Constants → $Θ(1)$.
* Linear → $Θ(n)$.
* Quadratic → $Θ(n^2)$.
* Cubic → $Θ(n^3)$.
* $n \log n$ → $Θ(n \log n)$.

---

### ✅ Key Takeaways

1. Θ gives the **tightest, most accurate description** of time complexity.
2. Always use Θ when exact growth is known.
3. Big-O and Ω are broader; Θ is the **intersection** (precise order).
4. If two functions have the **same leading term**, they are Θ-equivalent.

Here’s a **structured summary** of your transcript on **Analysis of Multiple Loops**:

---

# 📘 Notes on **Analysis of Multiple Loops**

### 🔹 1. Subsequent Loops (One After Another)

* Example: 3 loops, one after the other

  * Loop 1: runs $n$ times → $Θ(n)$
  * Loop 2: runs $\log n$ times → $Θ(\log n)$
  * Loop 3: runs 99 times → $Θ(1)$
* **Rule**: For **subsequent loops**, **add** complexities:

  $$
  Θ(n) + Θ(\log n) + Θ(1) = Θ(n)
  $$
* ✅ Overall: **Θ(n)** (dominant term remains).

---

### 🔹 2. Nested Loops

* Example: Outer loop ($Θ(n)$) and inner loop ($Θ(\log n)$)
* **Rule**: For **nested loops**, **multiply** complexities:

  $$
  Θ(n) \times Θ(\log n) = Θ(n \log n)
  $$
* ✅ Overall: **Θ(n log n)**

---

### 🔹 3. Mixed Loops (Combination of Subsequent + Nested)

* Part A: Nested loop → $Θ(n \log n)$
* Part B: Another nested loop → $Θ(n^2)$
* Since Part A and Part B are subsequent, we **add**:

  $$
  Θ(n \log n) + Θ(n^2)
  $$
* But $n^2$ dominates $n \log n$.
* ✅ Overall: **Θ(n^2)**

---

### 🔹 4. Multiple Inputs (Different Variables)

* Example: Function with inputs $n$ and $m$:

  * First part: $Θ(n \log n)$
  * Second part: $Θ(m^2)$
* Since **different inputs**, we **cannot drop smaller terms**.
* ✅ Overall:

  $$
  Θ(n \log n + m^2)
  $$

---

### 🔹 Key Rules

1. **Subsequent loops** → **Add** complexities.
2. **Nested loops** → **Multiply** complexities.
3. When combining terms:

   * If same variable ($n$), drop lower-order terms.
   * If **different inputs** ($n, m$), keep both terms.

---

### 🔹 Real-world Examples

* **Graph algorithms**: often analyzed with **2 inputs** → vertices ($V$) and edges ($E$).
* **Merging 2 sorted arrays**: size $n$ and $m$.

  * Time complexity = $Θ(n + m)$.

---

✅ **Takeaway**:

* Always check if loops are **sequential or nested**.
* Decide whether to **add or multiply** complexities.
* For **multiple inputs**, final answer is expressed in terms of both.

---

Would you like me to create a **visual cheat sheet (flowchart/table)** that shows:
👉 *"Are loops sequential or nested? → Add vs Multiply → Drop or Keep terms"*? That would make this super quick to revise.

Here’s a **clear and structured summary** of your transcript on **Analysis of Common Loops**:

---

# 📘 Notes on **Analysis of Common Loops**

We assume each loop body does **Θ(1)** work.

---

## 🔹 Example 1: Increment by Constant

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < n; i = i + c)
```

* Runs about $n/c$ times → $Θ(n)$.
* ✅ **Time Complexity: Θ(n)**

---

## 🔹 Example 2: Decrement by Constant

```cpp
for (i = n; i > 0; i = i - c)
```

* Runs about $n/c$ times → $Θ(n)$.
* ✅ **Time Complexity: Θ(n)**

---

## 🔹 Example 3: Multiply by Constant

```cpp
for (i = 1; i < n; i = i * c)
```

* Values: 1, c, c², c³, … until < n.
* Number of iterations ≈ $\log_c n$.
* ✅ **Time Complexity: Θ(log n)**

---

## 🔹 Example 4: Divide by Constant

```cpp
for (i = n; i > 1; i = i / c)
```

* Values: n, n/c, n/c², … until > 1.
* Number of iterations ≈ $\log_c n$.
* ✅ **Time Complexity: Θ(log n)**

---

## 🔹 Example 5: Exponential Growth (Power in Update)

```cpp
for (i = 2; i < n; i = pow(i, c))   // i = i^c
```

* Grows extremely fast: 2, 2^c, (2^c)^c = 2^(c²), …
* Only a few iterations before exceeding n.
* Number of iterations ≈ $\log_c (\log n)$.
* ✅ **Time Complexity: Θ(log log n)**

---

## 🔹 Key Takeaways

1. **Add/Subtract by constant → Θ(n)**
2. **Multiply/Divide by constant → Θ(log n)**
3. **Power/exponential updates → Θ(log log n)**
4. In asymptotic notation, **ignore floors, ceilings, constants, and log bases**.

Here’s a **well-structured note** from your transcript on *Analysis of Recursive Codes* and how to form recurrence relations:  

***

# Notes on Analysis of Recursive Codes  

### 1. Introduction
- **Iterative code analysis:** Count number of operations in terms of input size (straightforward due to loops).  
- **Recursive code analysis:** A function calls itself → direct counting of operations is not easy.  
- **Solution:** Write a **recurrence relation** that expresses running time.  

***

### 2. Example Function 
- Function `f(n)`:
  - If `n <= 0`, simply returns → constant work = Θ(1).  
  - If `n > 0`:
    - Does a constant amount of printing work (Θ(1)).  
    - Makes **two recursive calls** with input `n/2`.  

***

### 3. Writing Recurrence Relation
- Assume time taken = `T(n)`  
- For `n > 0`:  
  $$
  T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + Θ(1)
  $$  

- For base case (`n ≤ 0`):  
  $$
  T(n) = Θ(1)
  $$  

- This is how the general recursive and base cases are expressed.  

***

### 4. General Structure of Recursive Analysis
- **Step 1:** Assume cost = `T(n)`.  
- **Step 2:** Express recursive calls in terms of smaller subproblems.  
- **Step 3:** Add additional constant or polynomial work per call.  
- **Step 4:** Define base condition.  

***

### 5. Exercises from Lecture  

#### (a) Mixed Recursive Calls
- Function makes calls: `T(n/2)` + `T(n/3)` + Θ(n) extra work.  
- Recurrence relation:  
  $$
  T(n) = T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + T\left(\frac{n}{3}\right) + Θ(n), \quad n > 0
  $$  
- Base case:  
  $$
  T(n) = Θ(1), \quad n \leq 0
  $$  

***

#### (b) Linear Recursion
- Function makes **one recursive call** with `n-1`:  
  Work per call = constant (Θ(1))  
- Recurrence relation:  
  $$
  T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(1), \quad n > 1
  $$  
- Base case:  
  $$
  T(1) = Θ(1)
  $$  

***

### 6. Key Takeaways
- **Recursive analysis = recurrence relation formulation.**  
- Always identify:  
  - Number of recursive calls.  
  - Size of subproblems passed to recursive calls.  
  - Work done outside recursive calls (constant, linear, polynomial, etc.).  
  - Base case when recursion stops.  
- Next step (not covered here): **Solve recurrences** using substitution, recursion-tree method, or Master Theorem.  

***

✅ This set of notes captures the **steps for writing recurrence relations**, the **examples given** (two recursive halves, mix of n/2 and n/3, and linear recursion), and the **general method** for analyzing recursive runtime.  

***

Would you like me to also prepare **solved versions of these recurrences** (e.g., showing that `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(1)` simplifies to `Θ(n)` using the Master theorem) so you have full analysis ready for revision?

Great — this part of your transcript is about **solving recurrences** using the **recursion tree method**. Let me summarize it into **clear, structured notes** for you:

***

# Notes on Solving Recurrences (Recursion Tree Method)

### 1. Approaches to Solving Recurrences
- **Master Method**  
  - Formula‐based method, works only for certain recurrence forms.  
  - Requires memorizing cases.  
- **Recursion Tree Method**  
  - General-purpose method, no formula required.  
  - Often easier for programmers because it resembles how recursion actually executes.  
  - Sometimes only gives a good **upper bound**, but sufficient for asymptotic analysis.  

***

### 2. Recursion Tree Method: Key Idea  
- **Step 1:** Write recurrence in the form  
  $$
  T(n) = \text{(sum of recursive parts)} + \text{(non-recursive work)}
  $$  

- **Step 2:** Draw a recursion tree:
  - Root = **non-recursive work** at top level.  
  - Children = recursive calls.  
  - Expand until reaching base case.  

- **Step 3:** At each tree level, compute **total work done** across all nodes.  

- **Step 4:** Identify a **pattern** in the work per level.  

- **Step 5:** Add contributions from all levels = **total time complexity**.  

***

### 3. Example Recurrence  
$$
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + c n
$$  
(Base case: $$T(1) = Θ(1)$$)  

***

#### Step A: Build Tree
- Root contributes: $$c n$$.  
- Each child contributes: $$c \cdot \frac{n}{2}$$. Since two children → total = $$c n$$.  
- Next level: 4 calls on $$n/4$$, each contributing $$c \cdot \frac{n}{4}$$. Total = $$c n$$.  
- Pattern: **Each level contributes exactly $$c n$$**.  

***

#### Step B: Tree Height
- At each step problem size halves: $$n \to n/2 \to n/4 \to \dots$$.  
- Number of levels ≈ $$\log_2 n$$. (Formally: $$⌊\log_2 n⌋ + 1$$)  

***

#### Step C: Compute Total Work
- Work per level = $$c n$$.  
- Levels ≈ $$\log n$$.  
- Total = $$c n \cdot \log n = Θ(n \log n)$$.  

***

### 4. Generalization to Merge Sort
- Merge sort recurrence:  
  $$
  T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + Θ(n)
  $$  
- Using recursion tree method → $$Θ(n \log n)$$.  

- Even if constants differ (e.g., $$c_1 n$$ at some levels, $$c_2 n$$ at base), summation still dominated by $$Θ(n \log n)$$.  
- Lower-order terms are ignored in asymptotic analysis.  

***

### 5. Key Takeaways
- **Recursion tree method**:  
  - Break recurrence into recursive + non-recursive parts.  
  - Draw levels, find pattern, compute total.  

- Important Observations:  
  - Often each level contributes equally (as in Merge Sort).  
  - Total complexity = $$(\text{work per level}) \times (\text{number of levels})$$.  
  - For divide-and-conquer algorithms like Merge Sort, this leads to Θ(n log n).  

***

✅ With this, you now know **how to solve recurrences using recursion trees**.  

***

👉 Do you want me to also prepare notes for **other recurrence patterns** (like $$T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(1)$$, or $$T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1)$$), so you have ready formulas for **linear recursion and binary search style recurrences**? That way you’ll have a complete cheatsheet.

Perfect — this third transcript builds on the **recursion tree method** by showing **different recurrence types** beyond merge sort. I’ll give you **structured notes** example by example, so you get a full picture of how each type behaves.

# Notes on Solving More Recurrences with Recursion Tree Method  

***

## 1. **Exponential Recurrence** (Tower of Hanoi type)  
**Recurrence:**  
$$
T(n) = 2T(n-1) + Θ(1)
$$  

### a) Recursion Tree Expansion  
- Root: constant work = $$c$$.  
- Next level: 2 subproblems of size $$n-1$$.  
- Next level: 4 subproblems of size $$n-2$$.  
- Pattern:  
  - Level 0: $$c$$  
  - Level 1: $$2c$$  
  - Level 2: $$4c$$  
  - Level 3: $$8c$$ … up to $$n$$ levels.  

### b) Total Work (Series)  
$$
c + 2c + 4c + \dots + 2^{n-1} c
$$  
This is a **geometric progression** with $$n$$ terms.  

$$
\text{Sum} = c \cdot (2^n - 1) = Θ(2^n)
$$

## 2. **Binary Search Type Recurrence**  
**Recurrence:**  
$$
T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1)
$$  

### a) Recursion Tree Expansion  
- Root: constant work = $$c$$.  
- Child: next level constant work = $$c$$.  
- Next child: again $$c$$.  
- Pattern: **each level contributes c work**.  

### b) Tree Height  
- Number of levels = $$\log_2 n + 1$$.  

### c) Total Work  
$$
c + c + c + \dots + (\log n + 1 \text{ terms})
$$  
$$
= c \cdot \log n = Θ(\log n)
$$  

✅ **Final Complexity:**  
$$

$$  

🔗 Found in **Binary Search**.  

***

## 3. **Linear Recurrence (Divide by 2 but Double Calls)**  
**Recurrence:**  
$$
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(1)
$$  

### a) Recursion Tree Expansion  
- Root: constant work = $$c$$.  
- Level 1: 2 subcalls → total = $$2c$$.  
- Level 2: 4 subcalls → each with $$c$$, total = $$4c$$.  
- Pattern:  
  - Level 0: $$c$$  
  - Level 1: $$2c$$  
  - Level 2: $$4c$$  
  - … continues for about $$\log n$$ levels.  

### b) Total Work (Geometric Series)  
$$
c + 2c + 4c + \dots + 2^{\log n}c
$$  

Since $$2^{\log n} = n$$:  
$$
= 2n - 1 \cdot c = Θ(n)
$$  

✅ **Final Complexity:**  
$$
T(n) = Θ(n)
$$

# 4. **Summary Table of Results**

| Recurrence Form | Example Problem | Time Complexity |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $$T(n) = 2T(n-1)+Θ(1)$$ | Tower of Hanoi | Θ(2^n) |
| $$T(n) = T(n/2)+Θ(1)$$ | Binary Search | Θ(log n) |
| $$T(n) = 2T(n/2)+Θ(1)$$ | Balanced recursion (simpler than merge sort since only constant overhead) | Θ(n) |
| $$T(n) = 2T(n/2)+Θ(n)$$ | Merge Sort style | Θ(n log n) |

***

✅ These 3 together illustrate **the wide behavior of recurrences**:  
- **Exponential (worst)** – exponential growth when recursive calls are near full size (Hanoi).  
- **Logarithmic (best)** – when work halves each time and only one recursive call is made (binary search).  
- **Linear / n log n (middle ground)** – when problem splits in halves but overhead differs (balanced divides like merge sort).  

***

👉 Do you want me to also extend this into a **Cheat Sheet of Common Recurrences** (like a small “dictionary” of T(n) formulas and their results) for exam prep? That would give you instant lookup for most algorithm analysis problems.

Perfect 👍 Let’s build you a **Cheat Sheet of Common Recurrences** — a quick reference “dictionary” for exam prep and algorithm analysis. I’ll organize them by **recurrence form** and corresponding **time complexity**.

***

# 📘 Cheat Sheet: Common Recurrences & Their Time Complexities  

***

## 🔹 1. Linear Recursive Forms  
1. **Decrease by 1 (like factorial or simple recursion):**  
   $$
   T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(1)
   $$  
   → $$Θ(n)$$  
   *(each level is constant work, total n levels)*  

2. **Decrease by 1, constant extra work per level (Tower of Hanoi style):**  
   $$
   T(n) = 2T(n-1) + Θ(1)
   $$  
   → $$Θ(2^n)$$  
   *(each level doubles calls — exponential growth)*  

***

## 🔹 2. Divide by 2 Forms  
1. **Binary Search:**  
   $$
   T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1)
   $$  
   → $$Θ(\log n)$$  

2. **Balanced Recursion with Constant Work at Each Call:**  
   $$
   T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(1)
   $$  
   → $$Θ(n)$$  

3. **Merge Sort Style:**  
   $$
   T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)
   $$  
   → $$Θ(n \log n)$$  

4. **Simple Reduction Only (no doubling calls):**  
   $$
   T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(n)
   $$  
   → $$Θ(n)$$  
   *(dominated by the $$n$$ work done at each level)*  

***

## 🔹 3. General Master Theorem Form  
For:  
$$
T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n)
$$  
where $$a =$$ number of subproblems, $$b =$$ reduction factor, $$f(n)$$ = extra cost.  

- **Case 1 (subproblem dominates):**  
  If $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon})$$:  
  $$
  T(n) = Θ(n^{\log_b a})
  $$  

- **Case 2 (balanced):**  
  If $$f(n) = Θ(n^{\log_b a})$$:  
  $$
  T(n) = Θ(n^{\log_b a}\log n)
  $$  

- **Case 3 (extra work dominates):**  
  If $$f(n) = Ω(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon})$$:  
  $$
  T(n) = Θ(f(n))
  $$  
  (if regularity condition holds).

## 🔹 4. Famous Special Cases (Quick Lookup)

| Recurrence | Complexity | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| $$T(n)=T(n-1)+Θ(1)$$ | Θ(n) | Factorial loop |
| $$T(n)=2T(n-1)+Θ(1)$$ | Θ(2^n) | Tower of Hanoi |

| $$T(n)=nT(n/2)+Θ(1)$$ | Θ(n^{log n}) | Certain divide-and-conquer matrix recurrences |

***

## 🔹 5. Tips for Fast Solving  
- Always identify **number of recursive calls (`a`)**, **size shrink factor (`b`)**, and **non-recursive work (`f(n)`)**.  
- For **binary search type problems:** expect $$O(\log n)$$.  
- For **divide-and-conquer like merge sort:** usually $$O(n \log n)$$.  
- For **linear recursion with doubling calls:** exponential complexity.  
- Use **recursion tree** to spot geometric/linear/logarithmic growth quickly.  
- Use **Master Theorem** as a shortcut if recurrence fits the form.  

***

✅ This cheat sheet now gives you **instant lookup** formulas for most common exam-style recurrences.  

***

👉 Do you want me to also prepare **visual recursion tree diagrams** for these (like sketches of levels and total work per level), so you can remember patterns faster?

Excellent — this part of your transcript is introducing the **limitation of recursion tree method**:  
sometimes we cannot get an **exact tight bound (Θ)** and instead only obtain an **upper bound (O)**.  

Let’s make the structured notes clear:

***

# Notes on Upper Bound Analysis with Recursion Trees  

***

## 1. Exact Bound vs Upper Bound
- **Exact bound (Θ):** Found in many standard recurrences because the recursion tree is balanced and all leaves appear at the same depth (e.g., merge sort, binary search).  
- **Upper bound (O):** Needed when recursion creates **uneven subtrees** (different reduction rates). In such cases leaves are at different levels, making exact summation very hard.  

***

## 2. Example 1: Mixed Reductions  
**Recurrence:**  
$$
T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/4) + Θ(n), \quad T(1) = c
$$

### Recursion Tree Expansion  
- Root: $$c \cdot n$$  
- Next Level: $$c(n/2) + c(n/4) = \tfrac{3}{4}cn$$  
- Next Level: fractions like $$c(n/16 + n/8 + n/8 + n/4)$$, which sum to $$\tfrac{9}{16}cn$$.  
- Pattern: geometric progression with ratio $$3/4$$.  

### Challenge  
- Leaves finish at different levels → **imbalanced tree**: shallow leaves (from /4 branch) and deep leaves (from /2 branch).  
- So **not a perfect GP till the end**.  

### Solution  
- Assume recursion tree is “full” (all subtrees reach bottom).  
- Then sum = geometric series:  
  $$
  cn + \tfrac{3}{4} cn + \tfrac{9}{16} cn + \ldots
  $$  
- Since ratio < 1, sum of infinite series converges:  
  $$
  \frac{cn}{1 - 3/4} = 4cn = O(n)
  $$  

✅ **Upper Bound:**  
$$
T(n) = O(n)
$$  

(Actual complexity ≤ O(n), but difficult to prove Θ(n) without deeper math.)  

***

## 3. Why Only Upper Bound?  
- Because some recursive branches terminate **early** and others go **deeper**, the work done is **less** than the geometric approximation.  
- By “filling in” the tree to make it perfect, we **over-count** work → thus we only guarantee an **upper bound**.  

***

## 4. Example 2: Unequal Decreases Per Step  
- Recurrence where **one child decreases by 1** and **another decreases by 2**.  
- Tree looks unbalanced: one branch ends early, the other continues longer.  
- Exact leaf depth distribution is complicated.  

### Approximation  
- Consider as if the tree were balanced (perfect GP).  
- Work per level: grows like a geometric progression.  
- For $$n$$ levels, sum ~ $$O(2^n)$$ (upper bound).  

✅ Again, only **O(·)** is possible, not Θ(·).  

***

## 5. General Rule
- **Balanced subproblems (equal shrink rates):** Recursion tree works cleanly → exact Θ bound.  
- **Unbalanced subproblems (different shrink rates):** Recursion tree overestimates → gives a safe big‑O upper bound.  

***

# 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Recursion tree method is very **intuitive** but **not always exact**.  
- Use it to:  
  - Find **Θ bound** when tree is balanced.  
  - Find **O bound** when subproblems reduce unevenly.  
- Rule of thumb:  
  - If one branch “dominates” (larger depth), expect the total time to be bounded by the depth × max work per level.  
  - But for exact bounds, advanced techniques (Akra-Bazzi theorem, detailed induction) might be required.  

***

✅ Now you’ve seen both **exact recurrence solving → Θ**, and **complex uneven recurrences → O (upper bound only)**.  

***

👉 Do you want me to also add a **section on advanced methods** (like Akra–Bazzi, substitution method) so you’ll know how to attack these uneven cases in exams beyond just using O-bound recursion trees?

Great 👍 This transcript is about **Space Complexity** and especially the important distinction between **Space Complexity vs Auxiliary Space**. Let me convert this into crisp structured **study notes** for you:

***

# Notes on Space Complexity & Auxiliary Space  

***

## 1. Definition
- **Time Complexity:** Order of growth of *time taken* with input size $$n$$.  
- **Space Complexity:** Order of growth of *memory (RAM) required* with input size $$n$$.  
- **Auxiliary Space:** Extra/temporary space the algorithm allocates beyond input and output storage.  

***

## 2. Examples  

### Example 1: Simple Variable Programs  
- Program to compute sum of 1..n with a formula.  
- Number of variables: constant (n, sum).  
- Independent of input size.  
- **Space Complexity = Θ(1).**  

Even if $$n = 1000$$ or $$100000$$, still only constant variables are needed.  

***

### Example 2: Loop with Variables  
- Iterative program using variables `sum`, `i`, `n`.  
- Still 3 variables regardless of n value.  
- **Space Complexity = Θ(1).**  

***

### Example 3: Array Input  
- Function that receives an array of size $$n$$.  
- E.g. sum of array elements.  
- Array size grows linearly with $$n$$.  
- **Space Complexity = Θ(n).**  
  (because memory required for the array grows linearly)

***

## 3. Space Complexity vs Auxiliary Space
- For array/list problems:
  - The **input container itself** requires **Θ(n)** space.  
  - So all such problems have at least **Θ(n) space complexity**.  
- To compare algorithms more meaningfully, we use **auxiliary space** = *extra space used for computation*.  

### Sorting Algorithm Examples:
- Insertion Sort / Selection Sort / Bubble Sort / Heap Sort: **Auxiliary Space = Θ(1)**.  
- Merge Sort: **Auxiliary Space = Θ(n)** (needs an extra array).  
- Quick Sort: **Auxiliary Space = Θ(log n)** (recursion stack).  

> 🔑 Thus, sorting algorithms all have the same **space complexity = Θ(n)** due to input array, but differ in **auxiliary space**.  

***

## 4. Recursive Program Example  
### Recursive Sum of First $$n$$ Numbers  
```c
int sum(int n) {
   if (n <= 0) return 0;
   return n + sum(n-1);
}
```

- No arrays, just recursion.  
- Each recursive call uses stack space → activation record stored.  
- At peak, there are **n+1 function calls** in stack.  
- **Auxiliary Space = Θ(n)** (due to recursion stack).  
- **Space Complexity = Θ(n)**.  

***

### Fibonacci (Recursive)  
- Simple recursion: calls for fib(n-1) and fib(n-2).  
- Recursion tree height ≈ $$n$$.  
- At most **n calls in stack** at the deepest path.  
- **Auxiliary Space = Θ(n)**.  

***

### Fibonacci (DP with Array)  
- Uses array of size $$n+1$$.  
- **Auxiliary Space = Θ(n)**  
- **Space Complexity = Θ(n)**.  

***

### Fibonacci (Optimized Iterative)  
- Stores only last two Fibonacci numbers in variables `a`, `b`.  
- **Auxiliary Space = Θ(1)**  
- **Space Complexity = Θ(1)**.  

***

## 5. Summary Table

| Algorithm / Case | Space Complexity | Auxiliary Space |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Sum formula with variables | Θ(1) | Θ(1) |
| Iterative sum with loop | Θ(1) | Θ(1) |
| Sum of array with input of size n | Θ(n) | Θ(1) |
| Merge Sort | Θ(n) | Θ(n) |
| Quick Sort | Θ(n) | Θ(log n) |
| Bubble / Insertion / Selection Sort | Θ(n) | Θ(1) |
| Recursive sum (n calls) | Θ(n) | Θ(n) |
| Recursive Fibonacci (tree) | Θ(n) | Θ(n) |
| DP Fibonacci (array) | Θ(n) | Θ(n) |
| Optimized Fibonacci (3 vars) | Θ(1) | Θ(1) |

***

## 6. Key Insights
- **Auxiliary space** is the important metric for comparing algorithms, not just space complexity.  
- Recursive functions generally require **extra stack space = height of recursion tree**.  
- **Optimization often reduces auxiliary space** (e.g., Fibonacci from Θ(n) → Θ(1)).  

***

✅ These notes give you a **complete framework** to analyze memory usage in algorithms.
