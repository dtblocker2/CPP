# ðŸ“˜ Notes on **Asymptotic Analysis**

### ðŸ”¹ What is Asymptotic Analysis?

* A method to analyze the **efficiency of algorithms**.
* Focuses on the **order of growth** of running time (or space) with respect to **input size (n)**.
* Independent of:

  * Programming language
  * Machine speed
  * Test cases

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why Asymptotic Analysis?

* We donâ€™t need to implement the algorithm to compare performance.
* We can write the algorithmâ€™s **steps**, derive a formula for running time, and then analyze.
* Allows comparison between approaches without execution.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Terms

* **Asymptotic Notations**:

  * **Big-O**: Upper bound (worst-case performance).
  * **Î© (Omega)**: Lower bound (best-case).
  * **Î˜ (Theta)**: Tight bound (average case, exact growth).

---

### ðŸ”¹ General Assumptions

* **Basic operations** (addition, multiplication, comparison, assignment, etc.) take **constant time** (O(1)), regardless of operand size.
* Example: `1 + 1` and `1,000,000 + 1,000,000` are assumed to take the same constant time.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example Functions (Finding Sum of First n Natural Numbers)

#### 1. **Formula Method**

```cpp
sum = n(n+1)/2
```

* Operations = 1 multiplication + 1 addition + 1 division = constant.
* **Time = C1 (constant)** â†’ **O(1)**.

#### 2. **Loop Method**

```cpp
sum = 0
for i = 1 to n:
    sum += i
return sum
```

* Initialization, return = constant.
* Loop executes `n` times.
* **Time = C2Â·n + C3** â†’ **O(n)**.

#### 3. **Nested Loop Method**

```cpp
sum = 0
for i = 1 to n:
   for j = 1 to i:
       sum += 1
```

* Inner loop runs `n(n+1)/2` times.
* Total time â‰ˆ **C4Â·nÂ² + C5Â·n + C6** â†’ **O(nÂ²)**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Order of Growth

* When simplifying runtime expressions:

  * **Keep only the leading (highest power) term**.
  * Ignore constants and lower-order terms.
* Examples:

  * `C1` â†’ O(1) (**constant time**)
  * `C2Â·n + C3` â†’ O(n) (**linear time**)
  * `C4Â·nÂ² + C5Â·n + C6` â†’ O(nÂ²) (**quadratic time**)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Insights from Comparison

* **Machine constants (C1, C2, etc.) donâ€™t matter in the long run**.
* Example:

  * Function 1: `13` (constant time)
  * Function 2: `2n + 5` (linear time)
  * At small n, linear may be faster.
  * But after intersection point `n = 4`, linear grows larger.
* **Higher order growth always dominates for large n**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

1. Asymptotic analysis abstracts away machine and language dependency.
2. Only input size (n) matters.
3. Higher growth rate â†’ slower algorithm for large inputs.
4. Graphs of asymptotic functions are always in the **positive quadrant** (time â‰¥ 0, n â‰¥ 0).
5. Comparison is meaningful for large input sizes, not small ones.

---

âœ… **In summary**:

* Use **asymptotic notations** to measure algorithm efficiency.
* Analyze growth with respect to input size `n`.
* Ignore constants and machine differences.
* **Constant < Linear < Quadratic < Exponential** as n increases.

Do you want me to also make a **visual summary sheet (with diagrams of graphs O(1), O(n), O(nÂ²))** so itâ€™s easier for you to revise?
